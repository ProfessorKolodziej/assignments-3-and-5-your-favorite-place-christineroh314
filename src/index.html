	<h1>Top 5 Attraction</h1>
	<ol>
		<li><h2>Changdeokgung Palace and Secret Garden</h2>
				<img src="http://placehold.co/600x400" />

				<a href="https://thereshegoesagain.org/changdeokgung-palace-secret-garden/">Explore Changdeokgung Palace and Secret Garden</a>
				
				<p>
				While Gyeongbokgung is considered Korea's main palace, Changdeokgung and its secret garden actually served as the primary royal residence from the early 1600s to the 1800s.</p>
				<p>
				What makes Changdeokgung a unique palace to visit is its design. Instead of making the surrounding nature work with its layout, architects designed the palace to work in harmony with nature. When they worked on the Secret Garden, they kept artificial landscapes completely minimal to better highlight its natural setting. The Secret Garden was used for everything from banquets to recreation and even some farming throughout the centuries.</p>
				<p>
				It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, one of the most significant Korean landmarks, and the best preserved of all the palaces.</p>

			<h3>Travel Tips</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Book up to 6 days ahead of time.</li>
					<li>While you can stand in line and get a ticket to see the palace grounds, you actually need to be on a specific tour to visit Huwon (the secret garden). If it's busy, the tickets actually sell out quickly.</li>
					<li>Book “Seoul by Foot” (Secret Garden + Bukchon Hanok Village Walking Tour). You will join one of the 90-minute guided tours for Huwon, followed by a 2 1/2-hour walking tour that includes the rest of Changdeokgung, Bukchon Hanok Village, and Samcheongdong.</li>
					<li>There are English, Chinese, and Japanese tours.</li>
					<li>You can get there by taxi, the Seoul Bus, the local bus, or the subway. The subway would be the fastest and most reliable way to get there.</li>
					<li>By subway would be the fastest and most reliable way to get there.</li>
					<li>Address: 99, Yulgok-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>History</h3>
				<p>
				Changdeokgung was created in 1405 as the secondary royal palace. While Kim Taejong claimed it was because Gyeongbokgung's topography wasn't auspicious enough, many believe it's because he assassinated his brothers in the main palace and didn't want to rule from the same area. After the Japanese invasions destroyed all the palaces in the late 1500s, it was the first palace rebuilt and became the primary royal residence for almost 300 years.</p>
